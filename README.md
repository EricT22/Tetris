## Tetris in Java

This project was made during the summer and fall of 2023. 

The standalone source code is in this repository, as well as a runnable jar file, and an exe wrapped with Launch4j. The commit history can be found under the CSC 220 repository. 

Even though this project was not a class assignment itself, it was inspired by an assignment, Conway's Game of Life, which can also be found in the CSC 220 repository.

Hope that whoever plays this enjoys!
